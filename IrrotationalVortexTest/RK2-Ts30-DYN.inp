1                 ! NP - NUMBER OF PARTICLES
30                ! TS - TIMESTEP IN SECONDS
2010              ! RUNTIM - RUN TIME IN SECONDS
30                ! OUTPER - PERIOD OF TIME FOR OUTPUT IN SECONDS 
1                 ! RK2 - 0 FOR EULER'S METHOD, 1 FOR RK2 METHOD
1                 ! DYN - 0 FOR STEADY-STATE, 1 FOR DYNAMIC
5100              ! STDY_TIME - FORT.64 TIME FOR STEADY-STATE RUN OR STARTING TIME FOR DYNAMIC RUN(THIS MUST BE EXACTLY AN OUTPUT TIME IN THE FORT.64 FILE)
0.0               ! EDDY_DIF - eddy diffusivity (L**2/T)
0                 ! NWS - 0 if no extra wind Forcing
0.0               ! WFACTOR - applies only of NWS.NE.0 
1                 ! ICS - like ADCIRC, 2 for grid in lon,lat coords, 1 for Cartesian grid in meters
